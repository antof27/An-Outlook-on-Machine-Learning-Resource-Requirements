# An Outlook on Machine Learning Resource Requirements: Literature and Load Analysis Across Various Configurations

## Abstract
Nowadays Machine Learning and Deep Learning architectures have demon-
strated how far the horizon of human capabilities has expanded in recent
years. Despite their overlooked mechanisms and output results, the impact
they have in the underlying running machines is still underestimated.
In a fine-grained view, what is the influence of the principal hyperparam-
eters of a neural network on the computational and memory load? In this
work, we will provide an overview trying to interweave different aspects of
the topic.
We will discuss how these challenges can be addressed at various levels
of hardware design, ranging from the dataflow strategies of deep neural net-
works to the availability of hardware components and related areas explored
by NVIDIA. Subsequently, we will then create and fine-tune a multilayer
perceptron to perform various experiments on a defined dataset, discussing
about the related outcomes.
